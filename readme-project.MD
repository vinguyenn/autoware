# Group-465
Group members: Mariam Khan, Vi Nguyen, Beth Haessler

Project Description: Final Project for 465 (Secure Transportation Systems)

Details: We decided to slightly switch gears from our original idea (Blindness of car's systems due to loss of camera data and function) to swapping the data streams of the LiDAR detectors (front receives back stream and back receives front stream). This will have the same affect we originally proposed of blinding the car's systems just in a different way.
